        <h2>How to Pick a Guitar</h2>
        <p>It is like 99% about the color.</p>
        <img src="guiatr_3.jpg" width="500px">
        <p>My current guitar is by the brand Kona. This is the best guitar because I like the name.
            It also came with a Guitar for Dummies book which was perfect for me because I was 12 
            and also a dummie.
        </p>
        <p>The best way to pick a guitar is to go to Guitar Center or somewhere else that sells guitar
            and try a few out. You want to pay attention to the sound, the string tension, aka how hard
            you have to press on the strings to make them stop buzzing, and the size. You do not want to
            get a guitar that you can't hold. That is the worst.
